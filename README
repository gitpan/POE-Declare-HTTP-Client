NAME
    POE::Declare::HTTP::Client - A simple HTTP client based on POE::Declare

SYNOPSIS
        # Create the web server
        my $http = POE::Declare::HTTP::Client->new(
            Timeout       => 10,
            MaxRedirect   => 7,
            ResponseEvent => \&on_response,
            ShutdownEvent => \&on_shutdown,
        );
        
    # Control with methods
        $http->start;
        $http->GET('http://google.com');
        $http->stop;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple HTTP client based on POE::Declare.

    The implemenetation is intentionally minimalist, making this module an
    ideal choice for creating specialised web clients embedded in larger
    applications.

METHODS
  new
        my $server = POE::Declare::HTTP::Client->new(
            ResponseEvent => \&on_response,
            ShutdownEvent => \&on_shutdown,
        );

    The "new" constructor sets up a reusable HTTP client that can be enabled
    and disabled repeatedly as needed.

  start
    The "start" method enables the web server. If the server is already
    running, this method will shortcut and do nothing.

    If called before POE has been started, the web server will start
    immediately once POE is running.

  stop
    The "stop" method disables the web server. If the server is not running,
    this method will shortcut and do nothing.

  GET
        $client->GET('http://www.cpan.org/');

    The "GET" method fetches a named URL via a HTTP GET request.

  HEAD
        $client->HEAD('http://www.cpan.org/');

    The "HEAD" method fetches headers for a named URL via a HTTP HEAD
    request.

  POST
        $client->POST('http://www.cpan.org/');

    The "POST" method fetches a named URL via a HTTP POST request.

  PUT
        $client->PUT(
            'http://127.0.0.1:12345/upload.txt',
            Content => 'This is the file content',
        );

    The "PUT" method uploads content to a named URL via a HTTP PUT request.

  DELETE
        $client->DELETE('http://www.cpan.org/');

    The "DELETE" method deletes a resource at a URL via a HTTP DELETE
    request.

  request
        $client->request( $HTTP_Request );

    The "request" method triggers an arbitrary HTTP request.

    It takes any HTTP::Request object, and will respond with an
    HTTP::Response object to the "ResponseEvent" message handler once it is
    completed.

  running
    The boolean "running" method returns true if the client is both spawned
    and processing a request, or false if not. Note that it does not
    distinguish between running and idle, and stopped entirely.
